Client and Server 


This is a standard program created to connect computers to one naother computer for the purpose of sending and recieving messages through the Tkinter GUI. One computer creates a session which allows multiple computers to join into the chat and interact.

The connection requires the ip address of the server as well as the port number the server for each client to join. It also requires a name to be passed through when joining the server.

The Tkinter GUI ressembles that of a standard chat room with a blank text box for typing in messages, a send button for sending said message,and an exit button to close the session.
